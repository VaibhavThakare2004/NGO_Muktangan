# 🔐 Security Best Practices

## Important Security Note
**⚠️ This repository is PUBLIC - Never commit passwords or secrets!**

## How We Handle Secrets Securely

### ✅ What's Safe (Already Done):
- Passwords stored in Google Cloud environment variables
- No credentials in any GitHub files
- Environment variables set during deployment only

### 🚨 Security Rules for Future Updates:

1. **NEVER commit files containing:**
   - Passwords
   - API keys
   - Email credentials
   - Database connection strings
   - Any sensitive information

2. **Always use environment variables for secrets:**
   ```python
   password = os.environ.get('SMTP_PASSWORD')  # ✅ Safe
   password = "ActualPassword123"              # ❌ NEVER DO THIS
   ```

3. **When deploying updates:**
   ```bash
   cd thalassemia-backend
   gcloud app deploy  # Environment variables are already set in Google Cloud
   ```

4. **Files that should NEVER be committed:**
   - `SECURITY-GUIDE.md` (if it contains actual passwords)
   - `.env` files
   - `credentials.json`
   - Any file with actual secrets

## ✅ Current Security Status:
- ✅ Repository is secure (no passwords in code)
- ✅ Emails work (passwords safely stored in Google Cloud)
- ✅ GitHub can remain public
- ✅ `.gitignore` prevents future mistakes

## 📝 Future Development Process:
1. Make code changes
2. Test locally (use environment variables)
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. Deploy to Google Cloud (existing environment variables will be used)
5. No need to set passwords again - they're already in Google Cloud!
